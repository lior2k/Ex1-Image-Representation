# Ex1-Image-Representation
Tested with python version 3.10.1 using Pycharm

##### Ex1_main.py

##### Ex1_utils.py

* Read Grayscale/RGB images (using cv2 Imread/cvtColor/normalize methods)
* Transform images from rgb to yiq and vice versa (Using the @ operator to multiple with the required matrix)
* Perform Histogram Equalization on Grayscale and RGB images (RGB images are first transformed to YIQ and the equalization is performed on the Y channel)
* Perform Image Quantization on images
  Histogram Equalization and Image Quantization are implemented based on lecture notes and exercises ppts.
##### Gamma.py

* Perform Gamma Correction on images

All methods are implemented using OpenCV (v4.5.5.62) and Numpy libaries.
